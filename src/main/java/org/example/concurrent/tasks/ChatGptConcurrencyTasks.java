    ðŸŸ  Level 7â€“8: Advanced Concurrency Patterns
    7. Parallel File Processing
    Task: Recursively scan a directory tree and process each file in parallel.

    Goal: Use parallelism efficiently without overwhelming the system.

    8. CompletableFuture Chaining
    Task: Chain multiple async computations (e.g., fetch user â†’ fetch orders â†’ calculate total).

    Goal: Master the fluent async API of CompletableFuture.

    ðŸ”µ Level 9â€“10: Virtual Threads & Structured Concurrency (Java 19+)
    9. Massive Concurrency with Virtual Threads
    Task: Launch 100,000 virtual threads to simulate I/O-bound work (e.g., Thread.sleep).

    Goal: Explore the scalability of virtual threads with Thread.ofVirtual().start(...).

    10. Structured Concurrency with Scoped Values
    Task: Use Java's structured concurrency (via StructuredTaskScope) to run multiple dependent tasks with timeouts and error handling.

    Goal: Practice modern concurrent design using preview APIs (Java 21+).*/
